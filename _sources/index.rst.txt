Overview
========

The documentation for |MATPOWER| and its related packages are distributed across several manuals and How To Guides. The goal is to make all of this documentation available in HTML format, with some of the manuals available in PDF format as well. To facilitate this goal, the source for new documentation will be written in `reStructured Text <https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/reStructuredText/>`_ format for processing by `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ to build the HTML and PDF versions from a single source.

Currently, most of the User's Manuals are still available only as PDF, built from the legacy LaTeX source.

|MATPOWER| is a package of free, open-source Matlab-language M-files for solving steady-state power system simulation and optimization problems. It is built on |MPOM>|, a package for constructing and solving mathematical programming and optimization problems. |MPOM>| in turn relies on |MIPS>| (|MIPSname|) as a default solver. And |MOST>| (|MOSTname|), built on top of |MATPOWER|, is a framework for solving generalized steady-state electric power scheduling problems. All of them rely on |MPTEST>| as a software testing framework.
